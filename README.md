# FMDB - Movie Database Web App

FMDB is a movie database web application that allows users to search for movies, create groups, and manage their favorite movies in those groups. The application uses the TMDb (The Movie Database) API to fetch movie information, and it is built using Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars, and Bootstrap 5.
